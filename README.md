# goeats

This is a small 2D game I designed and built for my daugther (ma fille). Learn to think to move fast and deal with challenges to reach goals.
Even as the father I am still having fun at it. So defintively it is for all ages. This help use the keyboard direction keys and gamepad keys.
Move around a scene to collect (eat) foods (vegetables - fruits - lives - donuts). You will learn in english and in french the name of common
fruits and vegetables. At the same time develop strategy to escape traps and enemies. Just ***Go & Eat For Fun*** :)
